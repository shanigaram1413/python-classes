Operators:
=========
  Operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables and values. They can be classified into several types
1.Arithmetic Operators
2.Comparison Operators
3.Logical Operators
4.Bitwise Operators
5.Assignment Operators
6.membership Operators
7.identity Operators
8.Ternary Operators

1.Arithmetic Operators:-
====================
Addition(+):-
	Add two numbers or concatenates two strings
	Syntax: a + b
	Example:-
		#numbers
			result = 10 + 20
			print(result) #30
		#strings
			result = “Hello” + “Python”
			print(result) # Hello Python
		#list
			result = [1,2] + [3,4]
			print(result) # [1,2,3,4]

Subtraction(-):
	Subtract the right operand from the left operand
  	Example:
  result = 10-5
  print(result) # 5
  Note:	We cannot use subtraction for string. If will use we can get the TypeError.

Multiplication:
	Multiplies two numbers or repeats sequences like string or list
	Example:
      result = 10 * 5 
      print(result) #50
      repeat = “Hi ” * 5
      print(repeat) # Hi Hi Hi Hi Hi
      l = [1,2,3]
      print(l *2) # [1,2,3,1,2,3]
Division(/):
  Divide the left operand by the right operand.
  example:
    result = 10/4 #2.5
    result = 10/2 #5.0
  Note:- Division always return a float, even if both operands are integers.
  common Error:
      ZeroDivisionError
Floor Division(//):
    Divide the left operand by the right operand and return the integer quotient.
  example:
      result = 10/4 #2
      result = 10/2 #5
Note1:By using floor division will loose some value.
Note2:If both values are integers than only it will return integer value, any one is float it will return float value.
